# ECE391 Tips

This repository documents some tricks I explored during
[ECE391 FA2024](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece391/fa2024/),
focusing on environment setup and tool configuration.
It includes scripts and guides for replicating these setups.

There are guides for:
1. Environment installation
    - [MacOS](./macos.md)
    - [Linux](./linux.md)
2. [VSCode configuration](./vscode.md)
    - Debugging with GUI
    - Language server for code analysis
    - Code formatting

This repository does not include any specific course solutions, assignments, or code
that may lead to academic dishonesty.
The provided information is intended solely to aid in
understanding development tools and improving debugging workflows.
